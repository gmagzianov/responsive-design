            <h4>Start of an idea</h4>
            <p>
              Sitting in the office of what I thought would be a dream job as an
              assistant project manager for a construction company with a great
              reputation and ability for growth but, I had other thoughts in my
              mind of what really makes me happy. I started college with the
              idea of getting a degree in computer science which seemed like
              something I would enjoy since I was fascinated with new technology
              and wanted to be part of it. I soon became a little lost in life
              and decided that I would take a year off school and start working
              with my dad for his construction company. As I was working and
              felt more responsible,
            </p>
            <h4>Upgrade Mode</h4>
            <p>
              I decided to go back to school to further my career in
              construction and went for construction management. After a year in
              the program, I was hired by a great company that started me off in
              a position that I was wishing for. I worked hard and started to
              learn a lot about the business but something started to happen
              after a year of working. I didn’t feel the fulfilment that I
              thought I was going to have when starting that path. There was
              something else that I was doing that brought me joy like no other.
              I was really getting into videography as it pushed my creative
              side. I didn’t know if it was normal to have second thoughts about
              your career and I really didn’t like that I was having those
              thoughts. I felt that I was choosing to do something that was
              creative and I really wanted to be surrounded by like minded
              people. Through the process of creating the company I had to
              create a website which I found to be such an exciting task.
            </p>
            <h4>New Path</h4>
            <p>
              There's a certain process of thinking when putting together a
              video and feeling a similar flow when designing a website. I
              decided that I would take the path as a creative and put my talent
              as a video creator into product design. Design shapes how we view
              the world and so much of the we do things in today’s world was
              designed by someone that wanted people to have a better life. I
              want to be part of that and someday be the designer of a product
              that helps someone in the world to have a better life.
